A little handy web-based tool built with Angular.JS to turn off μTorrent ads with a single click. (well, okay, two, you need to grant pair permissions)

It's been a public secret for years that μTorrent's ever more invasive ads and flashy banners can be turned off with some simple tweaks in the advanced settings. 

I've reverse-engineered uTorrent's Torque API last year, and decided to take it a step further by implementing the possibility to change settings.
